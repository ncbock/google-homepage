Two ways to move a <div> around on the page
    - You can specify whether you want the element positioned relative
      to its natural position in the page or absolute based on its parent element.
    - Absolute units: [cm, mm, in, px, pt, pc]
    - Relative units: [em, ex, ch, rem, vw, vh, vmin, vmax, %]
    - You can use top: and left: to position an element along with the position: attribute
        * Move left- use a negative value for left:
        * Move right- use a positive value for left:
        * Move up- use a negative value for top:
        * Move down- use a positive value for top:

Stick a <div> to the bottom of the page

    - Set the position of div at the bottom of its container can be done using bottom, 
      and position property. Set position value to absolute and bottom value to zero 
      to placed a div at the bottom of container.
        * .example_div {
            position: absolute;
            bottom: 0px;
          }

Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
    1. Inline by using the style= attribute
    2. Internal by using the <style> tag inside the <head> element
    3. External by using the <link> tag inside the <head> element while
       specifying the path to your stylesheet. 

Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
    - A class is specified by .class-name and then selecting that class in the element
      using the class="class-name" attribute.
    - An id is specified by using #id-name and then selecting that id in the element
      using the id="id-name" attribute.
        * id's are more specific than a class and will override the styles of the class
        * id's should only be used for one element in a document.
